Kaccayana's documentation
=====================================

**Kaccāyana and Padarūpasiddhi interlinked files.**

Kaccāyana byākaraṇaṃ is a grammar text for the Pāḷi language.

Padarūpasiddhi is the commentary for the Kaccāyana grammar book.

This project was created to facilitate the cross-referencing of
the grammar rules (i.e. suttas) between 
the main Kaccāyana text and its commentary Padarūpasiddhi.

The two above mentioned grammar books are interlinked in this project. \
That is, the suttas of the same name in the two texts are interlinked.
